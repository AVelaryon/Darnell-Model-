# Darnell-Model-
Using random forest regressor to model SNEASY and BRICK, which are probabilistically calibrated to geophysical observations of the carbon cycle, climate system, contributors to GMSLR, # 135 and paleoclimatic sea-level constructions (see Methods for details). Each ensemble of # 136 100,000 future states of the world is a joint representation of future emissions trajectories and calibrated geophysical uncertainties, allowing us to examine the impacts of 138 interactions between these uncertainties on GMSL
